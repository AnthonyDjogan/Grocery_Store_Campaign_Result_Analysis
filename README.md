# Grocery_Store_Campaign_Result_Analysis
Performing an AB testing to evaluate the effectiveness of two distinct mailers, Mailer 1 and Mailer 2, against a control group represented by Mailer 3. This project involves a two-step approach.

Firstly, the chi-square test will help determine if there is any significant association between the mailers and sign-up rates. Subsequently, a z-test will be conducted specifically between Mailer 1 and Mailer 2 to ascertain if there exists a statistically significant difference in their respective sign-up rates.

The project aims to provide valuable insights into the comparative effectiveness of the mailers, aiding in strategic decision-making for future campaign optimizations.

## Result:
**Chi Square Test**

pvalue = 1.79868789769882e-08<br>
There is a relationship between treatment group and sign-up rate, they are not independent

**Z-Test**

pvalue = 0.08175576111699284
There is no significant difference in sign-up rates between Mailer1 and Mailer2

**AB Testing Conclusion**

From AB Testing we can conclude that the campaign is succesfully increase the sign-up rate, but we can not proof that there is a significant difference between the sign-up rate of Mailer 1 and Mailer 2.

**Recommendation**

It is more benneficial to use Mailer 1, not only because it is more cost effective but also because there is no significant difference in sign-up rates between Mailer 1 and Mailer 2
