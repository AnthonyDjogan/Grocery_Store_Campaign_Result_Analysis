# Grocery_Store_Campaign_Result_Analysis
Performing an AB testing to evaluate the effectiveness of two distinct mailers, Mailer 1 and Mailer 2, against a control group represented by Mailer 3. This project involves a two-step approach.

Firstly, the chi-square test will help determine if there is any significant association between the mailers and sign-up rates. Subsequently, a z-test will be conducted specifically between Mailer 1 and Mailer 2 to ascertain if there exists a statistically significant difference in their respective sign-up rates.

The project aims to provide valuable insights into the comparative effectiveness of the mailers, aiding in strategic decision-making for future campaign optimizations.
